I am doing my PhD in Computer Science at [Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), working with [Gaël Richard](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/grichard/) and [Changhong Wang](https://changhongw.github.io/).

I am interested in using Machine Learning methods for analyzing and extracting insights from temporal sequence data. My particular testbed is musical signals.
Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Sentinels](https://www.sentinels.ai/about-us) in Groningen, The Netherlands, building solutions for the financial transaction processing industry. I completed my Masters in Artificial Intelligence with _cum laude_ distinction at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) in 2020.

My PhD research looks at how inductive biases can be infused into Transformers by using the positional encoding module.
