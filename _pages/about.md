I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.sentinels.ai/">Sentinels</a> in Groningen, The Netherlands.

Long ago, I studied history. Besides travelling across disciplines, I have also travelled across continents. I grew up in Calcutta, but have experienced most of the big adulting events of my life so far in other places - Groningen, London, Paris. 

I destress by baking and giving out those baked goods to my neighbours and friends. I like trying recipes from different cuisines and cultures. My favourite sport is swimming, but the pandemic has made it impossible to do that.
