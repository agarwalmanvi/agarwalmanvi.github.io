  abstract={
  Music generated by deep learning methods often suffers from a lack of coherence and long-term organization. Yet, multi-scale hierarchical structure is a distinctive feature of music signals. To leverage this information, we propose a structure-informed positional encoding framework for music generation with Transformers. We design three variants in terms of absolute, relative and non-stationary positional information. We comprehensively test them on two symbolic music generation tasks: next-timestep prediction and accompaniment generation. As a comparison, we choose multiple baselines from the literature and demonstrate the merits of our methods using several musically-motivated evaluation metrics. In particular, our methods improve the melodic and structural consistency of the generated pieces.},
