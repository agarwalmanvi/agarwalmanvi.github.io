  abstract={
  Music generated by deep learning methods often suffers from a lack of coherence and long-term organization. Yet, multi-scale hierarchical structure is a distinctive feature of music signals. To leverage this information, we propose a structure-informed positional encoding framework for music generation with Transformers. We design three variants in terms of absolute, relative and non-stationary positional information. We comprehensively test them on two symbolic music generation tasks: next-timestep prediction and accompaniment generation. As a comparison, we choose multiple baselines from the literature and demonstrate the merits of our methods using several musically-motivated evaluation metrics. In particular, our methods improve the melodic and structural consistency of the generated pieces.},

  abstract={While music remains a challenging domain for generative models like Transformers, recent progress has been made by exploiting suitable musically-informed priors. One technique to leverage information about musical structure in Transformers is inserting such knowledge into the positional encoding (PE) module. However, Transformers carry a quadratic cost in sequence length. In this paper, we propose F-StrIPE, a structure-informed PE scheme that works in linear complexity. Using existing kernel approximation techniques based on random features, we show that F-StrIPE is a generalization of Stochastic Positional Encoding (SPE). We illustrate the empirical merits of F-StrIPE using melody harmonization for symbolic music.},
