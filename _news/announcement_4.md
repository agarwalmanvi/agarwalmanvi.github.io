This summer, I will be working on my project: "Benchmarking Modern Training Algorithms for Spiking Neural Networks on GeNN".

***

UPDATE: I implemented two modern training algorithms for spiking neural networks - bistableplastic synapses and SuperSpike - in PyGeNN. I reproduced the experiments described in the SuperSpike paper and created anexperiment for digit recognition using SuperSpike. I created more documentation and code samples to help new users createtheir own custom weight update models in PyGeNN.
